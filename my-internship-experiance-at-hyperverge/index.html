I did register for the on-campus Â internships and applied for 3â€“4 companies of which 2 were AI related Â roles and I got placed one in the end as well.</blockquote><p>The two good things I had done, in retrospect were</p><p>Wait patiently and not stress myself about not getting an intern in the first week or the first month because <strong><em>I knew that if I make a bad decision because everyone else is getting an intern, I will regret it later. </em></strong>I could have applied to many companies on-campus like Citi, Fidelity, etc for a software developer or analyst role <strong><em>but I did not, I waited for the right one and the wait was totally worth it.</em></strong></p><p>My Â plan was to apply to companies off-campus mainly through my personal Â contacts, LinkedIn connections and through companies online careers Â pages starting with large tech companies, then foreign startups and in Â the next semester to Indian startups.</p><p>My Â plan was to apply to companies off-campus mainly through my personal Â contacts, LinkedIn connections and through companies online careers Â pages starting with large tech companies, then foreign startups and in Â the next semester to Indian startups.</p><p>So Â I started by applying to super large MNCs like Google, Facebook, Â Microsoft, etc at foreign locations even though I have negligible chance Â of getting into them because <em>almost all of these large Â Tech companies require a minimum qualification of an M.S or M.Tech in Â Computer Science or Electrical engineering or plenty of publications in Â top conferences.</em></p><p>From these companies<em>,</em> I only got <strong>one positive response from Niantic</strong> a large game developer but I did not get through the programming test. Â After this, I started applying to foreign startups to know where I stand Â in the competition, quite surprisingly I got positive replies from Â multiple startups but I had applied to full-time positions rather than Â internship positions and they couldnâ€™t offer me an internship position.</p><p>From the second week of November, I started applying to Indian startups.<strong><em> In my opinion, Indian AI startups are doing some awesome stuff and are Â solving many real problems in India and I wanted to work in one.</em></strong> By February I had internship offers from few startups but back in the Â middle of November, I applied to a startup named Hyperverge which came Â for on-campus internships and I was waiting for a reply from them as I Â know them very well and was following their progress from past few Â months. After the vacation, once I got back to the campus there were Â multiple interviews and finally, I got into Hyperverge.</p><blockquote>On the whole, my long searching expedition was a great learning experience for me. <strong>In Â the initial weeks, I used to be disappointed that I wasnâ€™t getting any Â positive replies but my confidence has built up a lot once I started Â getting replies from foreign startups for full-time positions.</strong> In these few months I have interacted with many people from different companies and made many connections in the process.</blockquote><h2 id="getting-there-the-interview-process">Getting there: the interview process</h2><p>Applying to large tech companies off-campus is almost same as on-campus internships. <strong><em>Even Â if you are applying for an AI role, the first thing in the line will be Â a programming test to test your skill in data structures &amp; Â algorithms and programming in general.</em></strong></p><blockquote>The Â mistake I did was not to be well prepared with data structures and Â algorithms because I thought that they are irrelevant to what I wanted Â to do. But after taking the test from Niantic, I understood the Â importance of it.</blockquote><p>In startups, the process was a bit different. <strong><em>They Â mainly focus on whether you are good at DL/ML concepts and care a lot Â about any projects you have done in the field. There can be some test or Â assignment before the interview which would mostly(with few exceptions) Â comprise of some ML/DL concepts and maybe a little bit of programming.</em></strong></p><p>For Â a DL interview, one place in which you have to be strong is the basics Â of machine learning and DL and the math behind them rather than the Â super-advanced stuff. It is also recommended to have a good touch with Â probability.</p><p>Having good and relevant projects always help in getting an interview but during the interviews <strong><em>what matters is how strong you are in the basics and how well you understand them. </em></strong>In Â the case of Hyperverge, the process was pretty straight forward. The Â first step was CV shortlisting and then there were two interviews, one Â interview on DL stuff and the other is a mix of logical reasoning and Â algorithms.</p><h2 id="workplace-and-project">Workplace and Project</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2020/02/IMG_2189.jpg" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The Team</figcaption></figure><p>It was a lot of fun working at Hyperverge among a very young and pretty talented team of engineers. <em>I Â was part of the Documents team which deals with all the DL stuff Â related to documents like Text detection, Text extraction, fraud Â detection, etc.</em></p><p>My Â initial project was to build an algorithm to identify a certain kind of Â fraud in ID cards from a certain country and after that, we extended Â the algorithm to perform well on any kind of ID card out there. <em>In Â the process, I have also built an automated training pipeline which Â will be able to train DL algorithms on data which will be collected from Â users every day and update the algorithms in the deployment site in Â case of any improvement in the accuracy and send notifications to Â messenger whenever thereâ€™s an improvement.</em></p><p>I Â have picked up a lot of useful and productive coding practices and Â learned how to look at a problem and arrive at the solution (trust me Â itâ€™s a lot different from what you do in your projects in B.Tech ) Â thanks to my mentors Vipul and Anisha. I really liked the work Â environment and how friendly &amp; open everyone is irrespective of the Â hierarchy. I miss each and every one of them already.</p><blockquote>Apart Â from the project, the other thing I love about Hyperverge is their Â humble beginning and how clear the founders are about their goals and Â the direction in which they want to take the company. A quick background Â about Hyperverge, it is started by five IIT Madras graduates as a club Â called Computer Vision Group(now famously known as CVG) and later Â transformed into Hyperverge.</blockquote><blockquote>Throughout Â the two months of the internship, I have learned so much from the Â founders which I will not ever forget.
